# DATA-STRUCTURE-SORTING_SEARCHING-PROPERTIES-DATA
A data structure program that compares sorting algorithms to identify the most efficient algorithm for handling a dataset consisting of 20,000 rows and 14 using C++. Reading and storing the dataset into collections and execute the selected sorting algorithms. By  comparing their actual execution times and observing their performance.
